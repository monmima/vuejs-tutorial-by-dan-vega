# vuejs-tutorial-by-dan-vega

A tutorial by Dan Vega on VueJS. The tutorial is [free and available on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/vue-intro). What I like about this tutorial is that you just use **CDN** instead of doing the full-blown install through NPM.

Dan Vega has also created a [Github repository](https://github.com/danvega/up-and-running-with-vuejs/).
